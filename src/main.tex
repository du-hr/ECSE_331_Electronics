\subsection{Part 2: Diode Temperature Effect}
Start here.\newline
example: $x_{1}+x^{'} = \sum_{i=1}^N{K^{2}+1}$
\subsection{Part 3: Zener Diodes}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/zener_circuit.png}
  \caption{Circuit for capturing the i-v characteristic of a 3.3 $V$ Zener diode.}
  \label{fig:zener_1}
\end{figure}
Fig. \ref{fig:zener_1} shows the circuit that was applied to conclude the characteristics of
a Zener diode. A sawtooth input signal and varied amplitude was applied to the circuit. The behavior
of the Zener diode is shown below in Fig. \ref{fig:zener_2} and Fig. \ref{fig:zener_3}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/zener_simu.png}
  \caption{Simulation results of the Zener diode.}
  \label{fig:zener_2}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/zener_iv.png}
  \caption{I-V curve of the Zener diode.}
  \label{fig:zener_3}
\end{figure}
This I-V curve clearly shows that the Zener diode is operating in the breakdown region.
The Zener diode starts conducting large current when the voltage across it is below
a certain value, in this case that seems to be around -7.5 $V$.
Thus, the Zener diode breakdown happens around a voltage of -7.5 $V$.
\par The AC resistance inside the breakdown region is $\frac{1}{slope}$ of the breakdown region,
estimated from the graph to be about 15.3 $\Omega$.
\subsection{Part 4: Rectifiers}
This part of the lab focused on the rectifying of diodes. The circuit
shown in Fig. \ref{fig:rectifier_1} was configured.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/rectifier_circuit.png}
  \caption{Half-wave rectifier circuit.}
  \label{fig:rectifier_1}
\end{figure}
\par In a half-wave rectifier circuit, only the signal in the positive domain of
the wave is allowed to pass. In the experiment, the input signal is 60 Hz sine wave
with 5 $V$ amplitude. The simulation result is shown below in Fig. \ref{fig:rectifier_2}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/halfwave.png}
  \caption{Simulation of the half-wave-rectifier}
  \label{fig:rectifier_2}
\end{figure}
\par It can be observed that only half the wave is going through the load and the diode
triggers the voltage drop.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/rectifier_circuit_2.png}
  \caption{Circuit diagram of the rectifier with a 1 $\mu$F capacitor.}
  \label{fig:rectifier_3}
\end{figure}
\par For the circuit with capacitor in Fig. \ref{fig:rectifier_3}, a 1 $\mu$F
capacitor was placed in parallel with the load resistor.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/halfwave_1miuf.png}
  \caption{Simulation of the rectifier with a 1 $\mu$F capacitor.}
  \label{fig:rectifier_4}
\end{figure}
\par The simulation result in Fig. \ref{fig:rectifier_4} shows that since the
capacitance is too small, it discharges very quickly.
\par When the capacitance is increased to 100 $\mu$F, which decreases the time
constant and increases the discharging time, the output amplitude shows the appearance
similar to a DC voltage. Fig. \ref{fig:rectifier_5} shows such behavior in the simulation.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/halfwave_100miuf.png}
  \caption{Simulation of the rectifier with a 100 $\mu$F capacitor.}
  \label{fig:rectifier_5}
\end{figure}
\par For the half-rectifier with 100 $\mu$F capacitor, the peak amplitude of
the output function decreases to around 0.46 $V$. Given by $V_{p-p}$ = $\frac {1}{f \cdot C}$
, using this formula, we obtained a ripple frequency of 240 kHz when a 1 $\mu$F
capacitor is used and 22 kHz when a 100 $\mu$F capacitor is applied.
\subsection{Part 5: Voltage Regulation Using Zener Diode}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/5_1.png}
  \caption{circuit diagram of the rectifier with a voltage divider at its output.}
  \label{fig:5.1}
\end{figure}
By using the basic format structure of the circuit from the previous section,
we replaced the 1 k$\Omega$ resistor to $R_{1}$ and attaching an addition
$R_{2}$ in series with $R_{1}$ to form a voltage divider (see Fig. \ref{fig:5.1}).
We constructed $R_{1}$ as two 100 $\Omega$ resistors in series with two 100
$\Omega$ resistor in parallel which would have an equivalent resistance of
250 $\Omega$, on the other hand we used two 1 k$\Omega$ resistors in parallel
and in series with Two 100 $\Omega$ in series which is in series of two 100
$\Omega$ resistor in parallel, in such a way we have $R_{2}$ = 750 $\Omega$.
\par The output voltage is measured in Fig. \ref{fig:5.2}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/5_2.png}
  \caption{output voltage with voltage divider (input is grey and output is in black)}
  \label{fig:5.2}
\end{figure}
\par The average output voltage is at 3.3V.
The ripple is similar to the one in part IV, however, its amplitude has been divided,
which makes this approach to have the smallest AC ripple.
\par We modified the circuit furthermore, by adding a zener diode in
series with $R_{2}$ and replace the oscilloscope to the node where the Zener diode
and $R_{2}$ attached as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:5.3}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/5_3.png}
  \caption{circuit diagram of the rectifier with a regulating Zener diode}
  \label{fig:5.3}
\end{figure}
\par The output measurement and the input measurement is as shown below in Fig. \ref{fig:5.4}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/5_4.png}
  \caption{output voltage signal with a regulating zener diode}
  \label{fig:5.4}
\end{figure}
\par The average output signal is at around 2.3 $V$, however the signal itself
is smooth and have now visually detectable ripples. This circuit obviously
provides the least AC ripple among every other method we have tried previously
(including the resistor divider format).

%    The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression, ``One of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .'' Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks''. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
