\begin{abstract}
  The purpose of laboratory experiment was to explore the functions
  and characteristics of MOSFETs and BJTs. In the first part of this laboratory,
  the I-V characteristics of the MOSFET was found and drawn for different gate voltages,
  then the transconductance gm of the circuit was found. In the second part,
  the behavior of the MOSFET was studied at various temperatures.
  The same experiment was also conducted on the BJT transistor.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} goal of this laboratory was to test and explore the behavior of
 different transistors by drawing their I-V diagrams using the NI Elvis-II test instrument.
 More specifically, the I-V curve for the MOSFET and BJT transistors were drawn
 using the data taken with the NI Elvis instrument. A resistor network was designed
 to find the DC operating point of the transistors.
 Finally, the effect of temperature on the operation of the transistors was tested.
\section{Experiments Procedures and Result}

  \label{fig-1}
\end{figure}
\par The above circuit shown in Fig. \ref{fig-1} was constructed to measure $V_{DS}$ and $I_{D}$
and trace the I-V curve. This experiment was repeated multiple times with different
gate voltages $V_{g}$. A sawtooth waveform going from \SIrange{1}{10}{\volt} was applied.

  \label{fig-2}
\end{figure}
\par Next, in the same circuit, the gate voltage $V_{g}$ was increased to
\SIlist{3.1;3.6;4.1;4.6;5.1}{\volt}. For each case in the \SIrange{1}{5}{\volt}
gate voltage range, the $I$-$V$ curve was constructed using the data collected
with the Oscilloscope. Below are some of the results.

  \caption{$V_{g}=\SI{3.6}{\volt}$.}
\end{minipage}

\par Also, it is observed that when $V_{g}$ is greater than \SI{2}{\volt},
we start to see the behavior of the MOSFETs. When Vin is about to reach than
\SI{2}{\volt}, which is around the  threshold voltage according to the Manufacturers data sheet,
$I_{D}$ saturates.
